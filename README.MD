Basic Minecraft Bedrock Server Simulator (Python)

This Python script is a simulator for a Minecraft Bedrock Edition server. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate fundamental network communication principles, basic server-side state management, and the integration of AI-driven responses, all within the context of the Minecraft Bedrock protocol's initial handshake phases.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:

This is NOT a fully functional, playable Minecraft Bedrock Edition server. It handles initial network pings and parts of the connection handshake, allowing it to appear in your Minecraft client's server list. However, it does not implement the vast and complex game logic required for actual gameplay (e.g., world generation, physics, player movement, block interactions, inventory, etc.). When you attempt to "join" the simulated server from your Minecraft client, you will still encounter an "Unable to connect to world" error, which is the expected behavior.

Features

Network Discovery: Responds to "Unconnected Ping" (0x01) packets, allowing the simulator to be discovered and listed in your Minecraft Bedrock client's "Friends" or "Servers" tab.

Initial Handshake Simulation: Handles "Open Connection Request 1" (0x05) and "Open Connection Request 2" (0x07) packets, sending back their respective replies (0x06 and 0x08), simulating the initial steps of a connection.

Keep-Alive: Responds to "Connected Ping" (0x00) packets with "Connected Pong" (0x03) to maintain a simulated "active" connection.

Simulated Player Count: Dynamically adjusts the player count visible in the server list.

Simulated Client Sessions: Tracks "active" clients based on handshake completion and recent activity, including basic timeout logic.

Simulated Player State: Each simulated "connected" client maintains a simple [x, y, z] position.

Simulated Player Actions: When "play data" is received from a client, the simulator randomizes and logs a simulated player action (e.g., "moved", "interacted", "dug a block") and updates the player's simulated position.

AI-Driven Responses (Google Gemini API): Integrates with the Google Gemini API. When simulated "play data" is received, a prompt describing the simulated player action is sent to the AI, and the AI's commentary is logged and sent back to the client as a basic string message.

Server Game Tick Simulation: Runs a continuous internal game loop, simulating world events (like weather changes or mob spawns) and checking for client timeouts.

Basic Acknowledgment (ACK) Simulation: Sends simplified RakNet ACK packets (0xC0) in response to incoming "play data" to conceptually acknowledge receipt.

Structured Logging: Uses Python's logging module for clearer console output.

How to Run the Simulator

Save the Script: Save the provided Python code as mcpe_server.py (or any .py extension) on your computer.

Open a Terminal/Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Run the Script: Execute the script using Python:

python mcpe_server.py

You will see console output indicating that the server is listening and simulating world events.

Connecting from Minecraft Bedrock Edition Client
Launch Minecraft Bedrock Edition: Open the game on your preferred device (PC, mobile, console).

Go to Servers/Friends Tab: Navigate to the section where you can add external servers.

Add External Server:

Server Name: You can enter anything you like here (e.g., "My Python Sim"). The simulator itself will broadcast its name as "Python MCPE Sim".

Server Address: You must use your computer's local IP address. This is the IP address of the machine running the mcpe_server.py script on your local network.

On Windows: Open Command Prompt and type ipconfig. Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (e.g., "Ethernet adapter" or "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi"). It typically looks like 192.168.X.X or 10.0.X.X.

On macOS/Linux: Open Terminal and type ifconfig or ip a. Look for the inet address associated with your active network interface (e.g., en0, eth0, wlan0).

Port: 19133 (This is defined in the script as PORT = 19133).

Save/Add Server: Save the server details.

What to Expect:

The simulator should appear in your server list.

The displayed player count should fluctuate as the simulator's internal logic runs.

When you attempt to "Join" the server, it will go through the initial connection handshake steps (which the simulator handles).

However, after these initial steps, your Minecraft client will display "Unable to connect to world" or a similar error. This is because the simulator intentionally stops at the network handshake level and does not provide the actual game world data or gameplay logic that the Minecraft client expects for a full connection.

In your terminal running the Python script, you will see logs indicating when clients attempt to connect, which handshake packets are exchanged, and AI responses to simulated player "play data."

Why It's Not "Fully Functional"

Creating a fully playable Minecraft Bedrock server from scratch is an undertaking of immense complexity:

RakNet Protocol: The underlying network protocol (RakNet) is highly sophisticated, involving custom reliability, ordering, and session management over UDP, including encryption. This is a network stack in itself.

Game Protocol: Minecraft's game protocol (how blocks, entities, players, inventories, etc., are communicated) is extensive, proprietary, and constantly evolving.

Game Engine: A real server requires a full game engine to simulate physics, AI, world generation, and persistence in real-time for potentially many players.

Performance: Python is generally not suited for the high-performance demands of a real-time multiplayer game server at scale. Official servers are typically written in C++.

This simulator serves as an educational tool to understand pieces of how such a server might operate, without attempting the impossible task of recreating a full game engine in Python.
